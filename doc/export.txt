Echomail, first version:
  Just scan all database for messages that have id greater that last sent id for specific echo and match that echo
  One query for all echoes
  Slow, as requires heavy index access

Echomail, second version:
  Keep per-echo last-received, and before querying messages check that there are something new
  Per-echo queries
  Can seem hang if big archive was imported (long query and little output - mailer session may timeout)

Netmail:
  Use address hierarchy, each link receives all addresses under his subscribed addresses, except for the address
  has own link with subscription.
