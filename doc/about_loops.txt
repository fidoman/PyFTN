There is no need to detect loops specially - the looped message will
be detected as dupe as it's msgid is already in database.
But for the same reason looped netmail requires special treating - 
rearrived message can not be put again in database to have id 
higher than lastsend and so requires special treating to resubmit.

For example, id of message in database can be updated.
